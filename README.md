This is a simple dice game that involved Pooh climbing a tree to obtain honey.
You roll two dice. Once you add those two numbers together, you climb that many branches.
If you reach branch 30, you win.
However, there are some things that could interfere with that:
If you roll doubles, you fall four branches
If you roll a total of 4, wind prevents you from climbing
If you land on branch 10 or 20, bees will take your next turn.

In attempting to include dice animations, things were getting messed up. Not having the time to fix it, I unfortunately had to ditch them.
